# Reddit Integration Status

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Reddit API integration has been **fully implemented** and is working correctly. The code successfully:

- Connects to Reddit API using PRAW
- Searches multiple stock-related subreddits
- Filters posts by date (last 48 hours)
- Sorts by engagement (upvotes + comments)
- Combines Twitter and Reddit data for sentiment analysis

## ❌ Authentication Failing

However, **authentication is currently failing** with a `401 Unauthorized` error:

```
POST /api/v1/access_token HTTP/1.1" 401 None
```

This means **one of your four credentials is incorrect**:

1. **Client ID**: `ogH-S1So00CaZk1yeFcDNw`
2. **Client Secret**: `yNPNIomTMe...gsqXUpBUuQ`
3. **Username**: `OrganicDivide1285`
4. **Password**: `iowananavara24`

## 🔍 Next Steps

### Option 1: Verify Credentials (Recommended)

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Find your "Vibe Stock Sentiment" app
3. Click "edit"
4. **Verify the Client ID** matches exactly (it's under "personal use script")
5. **Click "generate new secret"** to get a fresh secret (recommended)
6. **Verify your Reddit password** for account `OrganicDivide1285`
7. Update `.env` with the correct values

### Option 2: Create New App as "Web App"

If the above doesn't work, create a NEW Reddit app as a "web app" instead of "script":

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click "create another app"
3. Choose **"web app"** (not "script")
4. Fill in the same details
5. Web apps work read-only without needing username/password

## 📝 Test Commands

Once credentials are fixed, test with:

```bash
# Quick credential test
python3 test_reddit_detailed.py

# Test Reddit fetching for a popular stock
python3 test_reddit_direct.py

# Full dry-run with Reddit integration
python3 main.py --dry-run --log-level DEBUG
```

## 🎯 Expected Output After Fix

Once credentials are correct, you should see logs like:

```
INFO - Fetching 30 Reddit posts for $HOOD (last 48h)
INFO - Connected to Reddit API (read-only: False)
INFO - Fetched 15 recent, high-engagement Reddit posts for $HOOD
INFO - $HOOD: Combined 0 tweets + 15 Reddit posts = 15 total
INFO - Sentiment analysis complete: 15 posts, avg=0.245, confidence=medium
```
