## How It Works Right Now

```
1. GitHub Actions runs daily (4:30 PM EST)
   ↓
2. main.py generates portfolio digest
   ↓
3. For each stock, analyzer.py calls sentiment.py (Grok)
   ↓
4. Grok performs web search for X posts about the stock
   ↓
5. Grok returns sentiment score + sample quote
   ↓
6. Email template displays sentiment + tweet
   ↓
7. Resend sends beautiful retro-styled email to your inbox
```

**Result**: You get daily X sentiment without any changes!

## When Will ntscraper Work?

**Answer**: When public Nitter instances come back online.

**How to check**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python test_x_sentiment.py
```

Look for: `Tweets fetched: 15` ← This means Nitter is working!

**Then what?**
Follow the steps in `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` to switch from Grok-only to dual-path (ntscraper primary, Grok fallback).

---

## Why Build ntscraper If Grok Works?

Good question! The plan was to:
1. **Avoid API costs**: ntscraper is 100% free (vs. future Grok pricing)
2. **Get granular data**: Individual tweet scores, not just summary
3. **Higher volume**: Analyze 30-50 tweets vs. Grok's 10-20 citations
4. **Custom analytics**: Power user ranking, temporal trends

**But**: Nitter went down before we could test it in production.

**Benefit**: The fallback architecture means you get sentiment TODAY (Grok) and can upgrade LATER (ntscraper) without code changes.

## Key Features (Built & Tested)

### 1. Spam Filtering
Removes:
- Keywords: "DM for", "pump", "crypto airdrop", "signals"
- Excessive hashtags (>3)
- Too short (<20 chars)
- Multiple URLs (>2)

### 2. Recency Filter
- Parses tweet timestamps
- Discards anything >72 hours old
- Logs warnings if <5 recent tweets found

### 3. Sarcasm Detection
Flags tweets with:
- Emojis: 😂🤣💀😭
- Patterns: "oh great", "just great", "this is fine"
- Excessive punctuation: !!!, ???

→ Reduces compound score by 50% if detected

### 4. Dual-Path Architecture
```python
if ntscraper_returns_tweets(>= 5):
    use_vader_sentiment()  # Granular analysis
else:
    use_grok_fallback()    # AI summary (current)
```

### 5. Confidence Levels
- **High**: 20+ tweets, <30% sarcasm
- **Medium**: 10-20 tweets OR 30-50% sarcasm
- **Low**: <10 tweets OR >50% sarcasm

## Monitoring Nitter Status

**Weekly check**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python test_x_sentiment.py
```

**What to look for**:
- ❌ `Cannot choose from an empty sequence` → Nitter still down
- ✅ `Tweets fetched: 15` → Nitter is back! Follow INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

## Next Steps

### Option A: Deploy as-is (Recommended)
1. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Add X sentiment dual-path system"`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push`
3. Enjoy daily digests with Grok sentiment! ✨
4. Monitor Nitter weekly with `test_x_sentiment.py`
5. Integrate ntscraper when Nitter stabilizes

### Option B: Test locally first
```bash
# Dry run (generates HTML, doesn't send email)
python main.py --dry-run

# Test email (sends to TO_EMAIL from .env)
python main.py --test

# Full run
python main.py
```

### Option C: Remove ntscraper (if you prefer Grok-only)
See "Alternative: Use Only Grok" in `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## FAQ

**Q: Why is Nitter down?**
A: X (Twitter) has been aggressively blocking scrapers. Public Nitter instances get shut down frequently. As of Oct 2025, all 9 tested instances are offline.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: ntscraper accesses public Nitter instances (not directly scraping X). Grok uses X's official search. However, scraping may violate X's ToS. Use at your own risk for personal projects.

**Q: Can I use Twitter's official API?**
A: Yes, but it costs $100+/month for search access (free tier is posting-only). ntscraper + Grok is $0.

**Q: How accurate is VADER?**
A: ~60-70% on social media text. With sarcasm detection, we target 75%+. Good enough for directional vibes, not trading decisions.

**Q: What if Grok starts charging more?**
A: That's why ntscraper+VADER is ready! Switch to it following INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md (no code changes to core logic needed).

**Q: Does this work for crypto/forex?**
A: Yes! Just add tickers to `config.json`. Works for any asset with X chatter.
